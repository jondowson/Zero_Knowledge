[[Homomorphic Encryption]]

While zero-knowledge knowledge-sharing approaches that do not use homomorphic techniques offer strong privacy and security properties, homomorphic approaches have their own unique advantages and use cases. The choice between these approaches depends on the specific requirements of the application and the trade-offs involved. Here are some reasons why one might choose homomorphic approaches over non-homomorphic ones:

1. **Computation on Encrypted Data**: Homomorphic encryption allows for computation on encrypted data. This is particularly valuable in scenarios where sensitive data needs to be processed while remaining encrypted, such as secure cloud computing, privacy-preserving data analytics, and privacy-enhanced machine learning.

2. **Outsourced Computation**: Homomorphic encryption enables data owners to outsource computations to untrusted third parties while maintaining data confidentiality. This is useful in situations where you want to leverage external computational resources without revealing the data.

3. **Data Aggregation and Analysis**: Homomorphic encryption can be used for secure data aggregation and analysis. Multiple parties can encrypt their data, and a central entity can perform computations on the encrypted data without learning the individual values, making it useful for privacy-preserving collaborative analytics.

4. **Multi-Party Computation (MPC)**: Homomorphic encryption is often used in secure multi-party computation protocols where multiple parties jointly compute a function over their private inputs while keeping those inputs secret.

5. **Complex Computations**: For certain complex computations, homomorphic encryption may offer a more efficient and scalable solution compared to zero-knowledge proofs or other privacy-preserving techniques.

6. **Querying Encrypted Databases**: Homomorphic encryption can be applied to encrypt databases and allow users to query the encrypted data directly without revealing the contents of the queries or the database. This is useful in secure database applications.

7. **Homomorphic Signatures and Threshold Cryptography**: Some cryptographic primitives like homomorphic signatures and threshold cryptography are built on homomorphic properties and provide unique functionalities that may be required in specific use cases.

It's important to note that while homomorphic encryption has these advantages, it also comes with computational overhead and complexity, which can impact performance. The choice between homomorphic and non-homomorphic approaches depends on the specific security, privacy, and efficiency requirements of the application. In practice, a combination of techniques, including zero-knowledge proofs, non-homomorphic cryptographic protocols, and homomorphic encryption, may be used to achieve different security and privacy goals in a holistic manner.
