# Zero_Knowledge

## Idea 1 - Atomic IP

### The Problem

The development of Intellectual property (IP) is expensive and time consuming.     
Patent offices around the world were conceived in a different era and struggle to keep apace with the rapid advancement of technology.    
In addition, its legal nature tends to reward Goliath over David and discourages many to engage with the process.     
Academic institutions are particular affected by the status quo as much of their income relies on IP and collaboration with Industry.    

### The Proposal.

A better approach would be to encourage participation in the patent process through streamlined processes and financial incentives.
This could be achieved with an IP marketplace that facilitates frictionless collabortation.     
This would be an enabling technology to speed up product / process development between multiple parties.        
This proposal would leverages blockchain and its core technologies as a trust platform.    
- [ ] Blockchain - so no one party has any advantage over the other (trustless platform). 
- [ ] Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) - capture intellectual property as meta data.
- [ ] Smart contracts - automate the legal and financial aspects of collaboration in a transparent and fair way.

The product / process IP to be captured on immutable blockchain(s).    
- [ ] The timestamp of the ZKP.
- [ ] The formal defintion of the ZKP.
- [ ] The ZKP itself. 

The structure and atomic nature of the approach enables.     

- [ ] Machines to perform nuanced interpretations of IP and award appropriately.
- [ ] Increased efficiencies for inter Academic / Industry collaboration.
- [ ] A fairer model of IP sharing that allows for greater granularity of IP ownership.
- [ ] Increased exposure for exisitng IP and new income streams. 

### The Platform.

A platform that provides these services.    
1. A marketplace for IP.
    - Search for IP via its formal defintion.     
    - Incorporate existing IP into a new product.     
    - Develop new IP if no exisitng fit found.   
2. A collaboration platform.
    - Create a new project and invite parties to join.
    - Choose smart contracts to govern product development and IP ownership.
    - Submit IP safely via ZKP and formal definitions.
3. A ZKP service for efficient computation and comparison.

Multiple parties can then colloborate on a project, where each must deliver a portion of IP.       
Each party can proove their IP conforms to its formal specification without revealing it.      
The final product is governed by smart contracts and financial / legal considerations are awarded.    
Other teams can ask to use any of these portions of IP for their products and royalties can be earned.
