# Zero_Knowledge

## Idea 1 - Atomic IP

A marketplace for IP and as well a means of multi party trustless collabortation.    
An enabling technology to speed up product / process development through collaboration.    
Leverages blockchain as a trust platform for collaboration.    
- [ ] Blockchain - so no one party has any advantage over the other. 
- [ ] Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) - capture intellectual property as meta data.
- [ ] Smart contracts - automate the processes around collaboration in a transparent and fair way.

The product / process IP to be captured on immutable blockchain(s).    
- [ ] The timestamp of the ZKP.
- [ ] The formal defintion of the ZKP.
- [ ] The ZKP itself. 

The structure and atomic nature of the approach enables.     

- [ ] Machines to perform nuanced interpretations of IP and award appropriately.
- [ ] Increased efficiencies for inter Academic / Industry collaboration.
- [ ] A fairer model of IP sharing that allows for greater granularity of IP ownership.
- [ ] Increased exposure for exisitng IP and new income streams. 

The vision.

A platform that provides these services.
1. A marketplace for IP.
    - Search for IP via its formal defintion.     
    - Incorporate existing IP into a new product.     
    - Develop new IP if no exisitng fit found.   
2. A collaboration platform.
    - Create a new project and invite parties to join.
    - Choose smart contracts to govern product development and IP ownership.
    - Submit IP safely via ZKP and formal definitions.

Multiple parties can then colloborate on a project, where each must deliver a portion of IP.       
Each party can proove their IP conforms to its formal specification without revealing it.      
The final product is governed by smart contracts and financial / legal considerations are awarded.    
Other teams can ask to use any of these portions of IP for their products and royalties can be earned.
